# Catsweeperüê±
With a busy schedule and little time, it feels like there are not enough minutes in the day to get my React practice in! That's why I decided to make a simple game just to keep myself on track. Thus, CATSWEEPER was born!üí£üí£üí£

It's a play on the classic Minesweeper game, but instead of mining and avoiding bombs, you are tasked to run from apartment to apartment to find fifteen lost kitties - but you have to avoid the angry neighborhood dogs or else you will lose your kitties forever (ie. you get bombed and game over!).

### GAME RULES
- The game works similar to Minesweeper.
- Click on an apartment door to find a kitty.
- Each door will either have a kitty or a doggo.
- Each game outcome will give you a PRIZE.
- If you find a doggo, it's **GAME OVER**!
- If you find all fifteen kitties, you **WIN**!

Day x (I've lost count, oof) of trying to code in React on my own was a success. I completed it with the following: React, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap. All the graphics were made by me with the help of different clipart compilations (credit below).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
